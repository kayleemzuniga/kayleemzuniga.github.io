<p> Sea lions are beautiful creatures that haul out in large colonies on rocks 
    and sandy shores on the Islands. They move into the water to feed and cool off 
    as needed. The sea lion is the most common mammal in the Galapagos. </p>
<p> There are many threats they are currently facing such as introduced species, 
    including dogs, carry diseases that can spread to sea lions. They are vulnerable 
    to the effects of climate change on ocean currents, which impacts their fish prey 
    abundance. They are also victims of bycatch in fisheries. </p>
