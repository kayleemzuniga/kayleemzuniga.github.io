<p>
    The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body 
    and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there are white 
    markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red pandas are 
    very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. Almost 
    50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their 
    long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably 
    for warmth.

<p>Threats that face red pandas are that they’re often killed when they get 
    caught in traps meant for other animals such as wild pigs and deer. They are 
    also poached for their distinctive pelts in China and Myanmar. Red panda fur 
    caps or hats have been found for sale in Bhutan. We are also causing a loss 
    of nesting trees and bamboo through clearing their forest homes, causing a 
    decline in red panda populations.
