<p> Orangutans are the gardners of the forest, playing a vital role in seed 
    dispersal in their habitats. They live in tropical forests and prefer 
    forest in river valleys and floodplains of their respective islands. 
    Orangutans' extremely low reproductive rate makes their populations highly 
    vulnerable. Females give birth to one infant at a time about every 3-5 years, 
    so these species can take a long time to recover from population declines
</p>

<p> Their species is threatened because orangutans are an easy target for hunters 
    because they're large and slow targets. They are killed for food or in 
    retaliation when they move into agricultural areas and destroy crops. This 
    usually occurs when orangutans can't find the food they need in the forest.
    Deforestation and habitat loss through humans making way for oil palm plantations 
    and other agricultural plantations are leaving no room for the orangutans.
