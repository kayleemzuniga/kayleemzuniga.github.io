<p> Now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/technology/elon-musk-twitter-plan.html">Elon_Musk </a>
    has completed his $44 billion deal for Twitter, lets walk through the math of owning the social media company.
</p>

<p> Its not just an academic exercise. Mr. Musks ability to make the numbers 
    work will have a direct impact on 
    the health of a service called the worlds town square, 
    determining what direction he takes the business and the 
    platform. If the financial case is grim, any plans to 
    invest in Twitter may have to take a back seat to simply paying 
    the bills. </p>
