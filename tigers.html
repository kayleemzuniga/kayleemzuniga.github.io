<p> 
    As a large predator, the tiger plays a key role in maintaining healthy 
    ecosystems. These ecosystems supply both nature and people with fresh water, 
    food, and health. Securing tiger landscapes could help protect at least nine 
    major watersheds, which regulate and provide freshwater for over 800 million 
    people in Asia. They prevent overgrazing.

<p> Poaching is the most immediate threat to wild tigers. Every part of the 
    tiger has been found in illegal wildlife markets. A result of persistent 
    demand, their bones, and other body parts are used for modern health tonics 
    and folk remedies, and their skins are sought after as status symbols among 
    some Asian cultures. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded, and 
    fragmented by human activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture 
    and timber, as well as the building of road networks and other development 
    activities, pose serious threats to tiger habitats.
